# Get-Recced

Not being able to decide what movie to watch was kind of frustrating. Sometimes I wanted to watch something breezy, or sometimes I might want to watch something serious, or something to beat-up the blues, and so on. This indecisiveness led me to take matters into my own hands. ðŸ˜¼

Get Recced! is a movie recommendation website that I built using Python (ML), ReactJS, CSS and all the works. It takes in the title of a movie from the user and using Cosine Similarity, an ML algorithm, recommends 24 similar movies that might pique your interest.
The ML algo uses the 'movies.csv' file which contains data of multiple movies, and accordingly initializes a similarity score for every movie by vectorizing every detail. This score is then used to generate a list of similar movies, which I retrieve using the magic of APIs. ðŸ¥¸

Here's how the project looks like:

Before doing this project, I always wondered how Machine Learning was integrated into everyday software; but now I know. 
I was able to design my own API using FastAPI, and tested it using PostmanAPI. It was fun watching your work actually be put to good use.

In the future, I _might_ implement more features. User profiles, downloadable lists, better algorithms and all that jazz.
